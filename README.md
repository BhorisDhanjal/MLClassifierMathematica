# MLClassifierMathematica
A simple machine learning classifier built with Mathematica

The dataset used was US housing data, with the following keys,
"region, price, type, sqfeet, beds, baths, cats_allowed, dogs_allowed, smoking_allowed, comes_furnished, laundry_options, parking_options, state"

The ML model predicts if cats are allowed or not.
The code can easily be modified for any other objective.

Source code as well as a pdf render of the notebook is added.
